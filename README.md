### Creative Project for CS 260

I began working on this project after our first lab MONTHS ago. This was going to be a direct rip off of "A Dark Room", an amazing text based game I had played years ago.

But my childhood memories of playing "Age of Mythology" heavily influenced the logistics game as well. As an homage to those days, 50% of the sound effects are directly from "Age of Mythology".

I hope you enjoy the game!

It was a lot of work and a lot of fun to write. I'm very proud of this project and will never forget all the zombie like coding days I spent on it.

Big thanks to Chris Tabaska, Dominick Lanni, Cole Hanson, Ali Young, Cyrus Cowley and Rex Boyce for helping me debug and balance.

And to everyone else for the support while I missed tons of homework assignments and school -- off stuck in my keyboard.
