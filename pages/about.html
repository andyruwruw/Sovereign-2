                <h1>Making Of</h1>
                <p>I'm currently enrolled in a web design class at Brigham Young University!</p>
                <p>I began working on this project after our first lab MONTHS ago. This was going to be a direct rip off of "A Dark Room", an amazing text based game I had played years ago.</p>
                <p>But my childhood memories of playing "Age of Mythology" heavily influenced the logistics game as well. As an homage to those days, 50% of the sound effects are directly from "Age of Mythology".</p>
                <a href="http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/">A Dark Room</a>
                <p>I did a ton of research online and was using an HTML tool called Canvas to display everything.</p>
                <p class="bold">It was a nightmare.</p>
                <p>I had no idea what I was doing and the hundreds of hours I put into it were my own fault.</p>
                <p>I had to define what a BUTTON was by finding the "X" "Y" of each click and hard coding button positions in. Everything was painful.</p>
                <p>80% of the code and functions were THERE, I just lacked the time to sit down for hours programming in buttons to displaying them.</p>
                <p>You can find that failed project here.</p>
                <a href="http://sovereign.andrewdanielyoung.com/">Sovereign 1.0</a>
                <p>I abandoned that and worked on my labs and other fun projects -- like a website that will 100% give you a seizure.</p>
                <a href="http://seizure.andrewdanielyoung.com/">This Will Cause Seizures</a>
                <p>Then we learned about Vue in class! I knew I had two weeks til my Creative Project using Vue was due, so I got a head start.</p>
                <p>It was a nightmare to convert the thousands of lines I had written for the original game to something Vue could understand.</p>
                <p>More time even to use layers and layers of Bootstrap Grids to display the screen.</p>
                <p>More time even to decide I wanted sound effects and search for the perfect ones online. </p>
                <p>MORE time even to add "this." to EVERY VARIABLE.</p>
                <p>In total, I have no doubt logged over 200 hours into this one project.</p>
                <p class="bold">2,019 Lines of HTML, 2,179 Lines of CSS, and 6,407 Lines of JavaScript.</p>
                <p>It's been quite the monster to sort through just to find what I need to edit.</p>
                <p>Looking back there are so many things I could have done better. I mean given that for every line of HTML, I had a line of CSS, screams something could have been done better.</p>
                <p>I will say this, a large portion of the code, which came from the original canvas project, was before I had learned much. The idea of pushing objects to an array to be read by a function that displayed them as a comment and kept track of their time was a MIND blower to me back when I wrote it.</p>
                <p>There are a bunch of repeating code that could have been solved with a clever method and better data structures.</p>
                <p>I also just read on Vue's website about components which apprently it said clearly:</p>
                <p id="quote">"In a Vue application, we donâ€™t want all of our data, methods, computed properties, etc. living on the root instance. Over time, that would become unmanageable".</p>
                <p>All those hours of scrolling through thousands of lines.</p>
                <p>I'm screaming. But I'll do that version next.</p>
                <div id="helloDiv">

                </div>
                <p>I unintentionally listened to the same song on loop for countless hours while coding this. It's the one playing now!</p>
                <p>It's probably the reason I wanted to make console a bit sassy.</p>
                <p>I just imagine this lil guy doing all the talking.</p>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw6u6YkTgQ4&">Hello World Song</a>
                <p>The plan is to work on some other random fun projects, then return to this project when I can do more.</p>
                <p>I plan on adding land tiles and a map, to let you invade other tiles for varying different resources abundant in each one.</p>
                <p>As well as view other kingdoms and form alliances. There needs to be a bit more story or choices to be made.</p>
                <p>My efforts to fufill that in this instance were special market items of which can be morally offputing.</p>
                <p id="goodbye">I hope you enjoy the game!</p>
                <p>It was a lot of work and a lot of fun to write.</p>
                <p>I'm very proud of this project and will never forget all the zombie like coding days I spent on it.</p>
                <p>To anyone out there who wishes they knew how to code, I barely know anything. I just put in the time. Emphasis on time.</p>
                <p>I researched what I needed to know, and made the best due I could with the knowledge I have.</p>
                <p>You can too!</p>
                <p id="goodbye">Big thanks to "Ctr-F" and "Double-Click" for being my pals through it all.</p>
                <p>But in all realness, big thanks to Chris Tabaska, Dominick Lanni, Cole Hanson, Ali Young, Cyrus Cowley and Rex Boyce for helping me debug and balance.</p>
                <p>And to everyone else for the support while I missed tons of homework assignments and school -- off stuck in my keyboard.</p>
                <p id="darker">Next project is a maze game called "The Libary Game"!</p>
                <p>Rules are you have to be in a public area with volume on full blast. The ball follows your mouse as you go through the maze of moving objects, and if you touch anything your computer plays really loud embarassing sounds which get increasingly worse!</p>
                <p>HA HA!</p>

                <p>Update!</p>
                <p>I finshed Sovereign a week ago, and yet here I am still pulling an all nighter to work on it.</p>
                <p>It's been a crazy crazy week. Ever since it went live, my friends have been helping me find all the small bugs hiding around!</p>
                <p>About 60 Patches and Git Hub commits later and here we are!</p>
                <p>It's an ongoing blast!</p>
                <p>I had no idea how much further I was going to end up taking the project, but one thing led to another, and it almost feels strange to image I published it without tutorials, a start intro, highscores, and added cheat codes.</p>
                <p>I hope you enjoy all the new content and I look forward to seeing those leaderboards!</p>

                    <h1>Full Farms means Full Bellies</h1>
                    <p>Food is pretty easy to come by.</p>
                    <p>Your only outsource is the citizen needs, which is one per month per citizen.</p>
                    <p>Hunting for your food seems pretty ideal.</p>
                    <p>However famines are a possiblity.</p>
                    <p>Famines:</p>
                    <p id="lessmargin">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farms make 30% less.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizens need x2 as much food.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Famines last 3 months.</p>
                    <p>Because of this uncontrolable event, it's best to keep farms well staffed.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally Robbers have a chance of taking food.</p>

                    <p>Deaths are calculated by how bad you lost.</p>

                    <h1>Rad Strats</h1>
                    <p>You've come this far to figure out how to play the game, now I'll share with you how to break it.</p>
                    <p>Not completly true of course, but I feel since the current highscores have already set such a high bar, you deserve to know the secrets.</p>
                    <p>I would patch the following methods, but that'd essentially make the highest scores impossible to beat.</p>
                    <p>Not only did the people who set them sit down for a long period of time to set them, but they played long enough to realize and exploit the subtle details they found.</p>
                    <p>They're dedication alone stands by their highscores, but you deserve a shot too right?</p>
                    <p>Here are the secrets...</p>
                    <h1>1. The Arms Dealer</h1>
                    <p>Buying and selling from the market was intentionally made to seem expensive, overpriced items encourages you avoid purchasing unless need arrises.</p>
                    <p>Late game lumber and other resources become irrelevant and stocked high, so it offers a way to exchange that into something useful again.</p>
                    <p>I set the price for weapons high assuming it would be futile to use unless you completely lacked stone.</p>
                    <p>However the game uses the same worth values for buying and selling. Therefore you can make weapons CHEAP and sell them for LOTS of gold.</p>
                    <p>This allows you to turn small amounts of gold and stone, into large amounts of other resources.</p>
                    <p>Match that with the Wizard's Spell and you have chance of exploding your resources full of enough to last you years.</p>
                    <p>The game tracks your average actions per month, which is logged with your high score. If you take a look at the highest scores, you'll notice they're rediculously high.</p>
                    <p>It's a funny downside to the tactic. The market has a multiplyer in which you can sell in larger quantities, weapons does not.</p>
                    <p>You want to break the high score? Break they're button presses per month in buying and selling weapons.</p>
                    <h1>2. The Underwhelming Villiage</h1>
                    <p>Sovereign has a few ways of determining how much bad luck to throw your way.</p>
                    <p>The first of which is a short 3 month grace period at the start to allow you to begin to build up.</p>
                    <p>Simply put, satisfaction depressions are lowered to allow you to focus completely on your small stockpile of resources.</p>
                    <p>The second is unavoidable. Sovereign begins to add to the chance of invasions and disasters each month after your first year.</p>
                    <p>Invasions and Disasters happen every 20-25 days, in which you have a CHANCE of either. In late game your chance of such events is 100%.</p>
                    <p>The last way, which IS exploitable, is by population.</p>
                    <p>Sovereign won't bash you right after a huge loss of citizens, and does that by checking your population.</p>
                    <p>Invasions themselves can be game breaking, but only occur after your population grows past 30 people. Additionally they're strength is determined by your population.</p>
                    <p>You'll notice some of the highscores have low max populations, because they decided to stay low.</p>
                    <p>Obvious downside is the complete lack of labor. The difficulty of the game increases anyways overtime.</p>
                    <p>However with that low of a population, you can focus your labor on resources and depend on hunting for food.</p>
                    <p>Might not seem like the grandest way to run your empire, but the end game is survival.</p>
                    <h1>3. The Dictator</h1>
                    <p>Gold solves all of your issues.</p>
                    <p>Get enough and you'll be fine no matter what.</p>
                    <p>Taxes will lower your satisfaction but with enough money to buy food, a stream of feasts and faires will keep you afloat.</p>
                    <p>With enough gold, some of the special market items are cruel, but offer high rewards.</p>
                    <p>Taking advantage of them requires a high amount of gold.</p>
                    <p>This method is more useful mid or late game, but can have long lasting results.</p>
