                <h1>Making Of</h1>
                <p>I'm currently enrolled in a web design class at Brigham Young University!</p>
                <p>I began working on this project after our first lab MONTHS ago. This was going to be a direct rip off of "A Dark Room", an amazing text based game I had played years ago.</p>
                <p>But my childhood memories of playing "Age of Mythology" heavily influenced the logistics game as well. As an homage to those days, 50% of the sound effects are directly from "Age of Mythology".</p>
                <a href="http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/">A Dark Room</a>
                <p>I did a ton of research online and was using an HTML tool called Canvas to display everything.</p>
                <p class="bold">It was a nightmare.</p>
                <p>I had no idea what I was doing and the hundreds of hours I put into it were my own fault.</p>
                <p>I had to define what a BUTTON was by finding the "X" "Y" of each click and hard coding button positions in. Everything was painful.</p>
                <p>80% of the code and functions were THERE, I just lacked the time to sit down for hours programming in buttons to displaying them.</p>
                <p>You can find that failed project here.</p>
                <a href="http://sovereign.andrewdanielyoung.com/">Sovereign 1.0</a>
                <p>I abandoned that and worked on my labs and other fun projects -- like a website that will 100% give you a seizure.</p>
                <a href="http://seizure.andrewdanielyoung.com/">This Will Cause Seizures</a>
                <p>Then we learned about Vue in class! I knew I had two weeks til my Creative Project using Vue was due, so I got a head start.</p>
                <p>It was a nightmare to convert the thousands of lines I had written for the original game to something Vue could understand.</p>
                <p>More time even to use layers and layers of Bootstrap Grids to display the screen.</p>
                <p>More time even to decide I wanted sound effects and search for the perfect ones online. </p>
                <p>MORE time even to add "this." to EVERY VARIABLE.</p>
                <p>In total, I have no doubt logged over 200 hours into this one project.</p>
                <p class="bold">1,636 Lines of HTML, 1,672 Lines of CSS, and 4,442 Lines of JavaScript.</p>
                <p>It's been quite the monster to sort through just to find what I need to edit.</p>
                <p>Looking back there are so many things I could have done better. I mean given that for every line of HTML, I had a line of CSS, screams something could have been done better.</p>
                <p>I will say this, a large portion of the code, which came from the original canvas project, was before I had learned much. The idea of pushing objects to an array to be read by a function that displayed them as a comment and kept track of their time was a MIND blower to me back when I wrote it.</p>
                <p>There are a bunch of repeating code that could have been solved with a clever method and better data structures.</p>
                <p>I also just read on Vue's website about components which apprently it said clearly:</p>
                <p id="quote">"In a Vue application, we donâ€™t want all of our data, methods, computed properties, etc. living on the root instance. Over time, that would become unmanageable".</p>
                <p>All those hours of scrolling through thousands of lines.</p>
                <p>I'm screaming. But I'll do that version next.</p>
                <div id="helloDiv">
                    <img id="helloworld" src="https://i.ibb.co/h9ZPhj0/hello-world-00000.jpg" alt="hello-world-00000">
                </div>
                <p>I unintentionally listened to the same song on loop for countless hours while coding this. It's the one playing now!</p>
                <p>It's probably the reason I wanted to make console a bit sassy.</p>
                <p>I just imagine this lil guy doing all the talking.</p>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw6u6YkTgQ4&">Hello World Song</a>
                <p>The plan is to work on some other random fun projects, then return to this project when I can do more.</p>
                <p>I plan on adding land tiles and a map, to let you invade other tiles for varying different resources abundant in each one.</p>
                <p>As well as view other kingdoms and form alliances. There needs to be a bit more story or choices to be made.</p>
                <p>My efforts to fufill that in this instance were special market items of which can be morally offputing.</p>
                <p id="goodbye">I hope you enjoy the game!</p>
                <p>It was a lot of work and a lot of fun to write.</p>
                <p>I'm very proud of this project and will never forget all the zombie like coding days I spent on it.</p>
                <p>To anyone out there who wishes they knew how to code, I barely know anything. I just put in the time. Emphasis on time.</p>
                <p>I researched what I needed to know, and made the best due I could with the knowledge I have.</p>
                <p>You can too!</p>
                <p id="goodbye">Big thanks to "Ctr-F" and "Double-Click" for being my pals through it all.</p>
                <p>But in all realness, big thanks to Chris Tabaska, Dominick Lanni, Cole Hanson, Ali Young, Cyrus Cowley and Rex Boyce for helping me debug and balance.</p>
                <p>And to everyone else for the support while I missed tons of homework assignments and school -- off stuck in my keyboard.</p>
                <p id="darker">Next project is a maze game called "The Libary Game"!</p>
                <p>Rules are you have to be in a public area with volume on full blast. The ball follows your mouse as you go through the maze of moving objects, and if you touch anything your computer plays really loud embarassing sounds which get increasingly worse!</p>
                <p>HA HA!</p>
                <p>Farewell</p>

                    <h1>Full Farms means Full Bellies</h1>
                    <p>Food is pretty easy to come by.</p>
                    <p>Your ownly outsource is the citizen needs, which is one per month per citizen.</p>
                    <p>Hunting for your food seems pretty ideal.</p>
                    <p>However famines are a possiblity.</p>
                    <p>Famines:</p>
                    <p id="lessmargin">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farms make 30% less.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizens need x2 as much food.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Famines last 3 months.</p>
                    <p>Because of this uncontrolable event, it's best to keep farms well staffed.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally Robbers have a chance of taking food.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lost invasions will take food as well.</p>

                    <h1>BE PREPARED</h1>
                    <p>Invasions start happening after you go past 30 citizens.</p>
                    <p>The enemy strength is determined by your population.</p>
                    <p>The more people you have, the more you should invest in defences.</p>
                    <p>Ways to Defend</p>

                    <p id="lessmargin">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soldiers cost a monthly wage.</p>
                    <p id="lessmargin">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archers cost a monthly wage.</p>
                    <p id="lessmargin">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catapults require two soldiers to man and wages.</p>

                    <p>Should you lose an invasion, you're kingdom is ransacked of its resources.</p>
                    <p>Deaths are calculated by how bad you lost.</p>
                    <p>Better defenses mean less deaths.</p>
                    <p>After every invasion, soldiers, archers and catapults are the first to die.</p>
                    <p>So remember to restrengthen after every battle!</p>
